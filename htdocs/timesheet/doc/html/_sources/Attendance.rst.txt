Timesheet approval admin access
===============================

To be able to modify the status of the timesheet, an admin page is
available (see the users rights screenshots in the Approval section),
even if all fields are editable itâ€™s not recommended to change anything
beside the status and/or note (a task-time need to be in the correct
week for the correct user to be taken into account in all the other
screens)
